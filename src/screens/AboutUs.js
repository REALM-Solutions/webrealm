I would have showed up early to get a few games in before class!".<br/><br/> On the Quad was created to address that exact problem. Since Auraria is a commuter campus, students of MSU Denver, CU Denver and CCD are not always aware of events on campus, or they aren't on campus during an event. With On the Quad, you can easily find out which events are happening on campus as well as hosting your own!</p>
